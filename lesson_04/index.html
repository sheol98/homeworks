          Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday
          life over the past decade.
        </p>
        <p class="text1-02">
          It is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and
          family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical
          breakthroughs.
        </p>
        <p class="text1-03">
          But the rise of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta AI has been
          accompanied by concern about the technology's environmental impact,
          ethical implications and data use.

        <h2 class="sub-title-02">What is AI and what is it used for?</h2>
        <p class="text2-01">
          AI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify
          patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that
          information.
        </p>
        <p class="text2-02">Computers cannot think, empathise or reason.</p>
        <p class="text2-03">
          However, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks
          which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how
          people acquire and use knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="text2-04">
          This could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper
          might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.
        </p>
        <p class="text2-05">
          The technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like
          Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, and is being used to develop systems
          for self-driving cars.
        </p>
        <p class="text2-06">
          AI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what
          posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to
          suggest music.
        </p>
        <p class="text2-07">
          There are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use
          AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and
          identify new treatments.
